<h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p align='justify'>At present time, we all use many web-applications and windows applications. Sometimes using this apps become so boring. But we can’t think of our basic life without using it. For instance, sending mail has become a very important part of our life and yet, it’s so boring to type and add selected files to it. Or putting our login credentials to different web apps. The part that we almost never talk about is losing our login credentials to hackers. It is very easy for the hackers to put a simple keylogger into any files and get all our important information; information like credit card number, pin codes, email and passwords. Think about our web browser. We usually saved our password into it. It may be the easiest way for the hackers to get our full information. As a close victim to this attack, I feel the need to create a software which will do this all the boring yet needed work for us; Serena, a virtual assistant who will cover all the problem above and more.</p>


<h2>Objectives & Motivations:</h2>

<p align='justify'>
In this semester, I have tried to complete a windows system/app that would help me and make my life a little bit easier. Of course, there are other software that could satisfy my needs, but none of the apps are free or need to be cracked. As in our country, we are not used to pay for real software and thus we ended up with cracked version. Most of the time, the cracked software contains numerous virus. Ransomware, keylogger, rat, Trojan are few of them. As I stated before, I have witnessed these attacks and it motivates me to create an not hack-able system that could at least be a wall between the users and hackers. Also, I intend to make this a free app, so people can download and utilize its power and benefits. 
    
<h2>Methodology:</h2>

<p align='justify'>
For the software development process, I used Iterative model as the main SDLC. I had chosen it mainly because I need to continuously add different features and functions. I had to build different versions of same functions with different requirements. Iterative model gives the chance to parallel work on different builds and the results of them can be obtained periodically. The testing and debugging are easy because of its small structure. User send voice command over the dedicad Android app and using a dedicated server, the windows software receives it and act according to the command. The windows software has 2 different voices to conduct all the commands.

## Features:  
    
    * Generate password and automate login for web apps to be secured from hacking.  
    * Voice messages to mail.  
    * YouTube Video Downloader.  
        * Option to download video while playing video in web app. (like IDM).  
        * Give the downloaded video a key to categorize.  
        * Create playlist of downloaded video and run it.  
        * Search any file in windows explorer and send it via mail.  
    * Open any website using voice commands.  
    * Create audiobooks.  
    * Summarize any writings.    

## Tools and Technology:  
    
    * Language: Python 3, Java  
    * Framework: Selenium, pywinauto, win32com
    * GUI: Pyqt5, Android  
    * Packages: Beautiful Soup, OpenCV.

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p align='justify'>
This software doesn’t have an eye-catching UI or impossible level features. But It can still be very useful for our day to day boring jobs. It has the potential to be a full-blown up AI powered virtual assistant. I believe it can help user to login safely and anonymously. It could also help the introverts who are afraid of giving presentation or speech. With a touch of creativity, it has the potential to give a full-blown attractive presentation.
